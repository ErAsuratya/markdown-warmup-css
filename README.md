#### A funny story
  When I was in college, I went out to party with some of my friends. I was drunk as skunk that night. And later after the party, we went out to roam around the city though we barely could stand still. The following morning when I woke up whole my body was in pain, as if I was beaten to death :smile: &nbsp; . I called one of my friends who were with me last night as I had no idea what I had done. Only then, I came to know that I did some HIT workouts :grinning: &nbsp; . I had done 60 push ups, tried one hand push up and even hung upon a branch of tree to try pull ups, which I don't even try when I am sober. I did not beleive him until I saw the video of me doing such stupidity. 


##### TLDR
  I possess super powers when I am drunk. :muscle:
