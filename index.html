        <p>  you need a good friend ðŸ˜‡  .</p>

        <h5>A funny story</h5>

        <p> When I was in college, I went out to party with some of my friends. I was drunk as skunk that night. And later after the party, we went out to roam around
            the city though we barely could stand still. The following morning when I woke up whole my body was in pain, as if I was beaten to death ðŸ˜„  .
        I called one of my friends who were with me last night as I had no idea what I had done. Only then, I came to know that I did some HIT workouts ðŸ˜€. I had done 60 push ups, tried one hand push up and even hung upon a branch of tree to try pull ups, which I don't even try when I am sober. I did not beleive him until I saw the video of me doing such stupidity. </p>

        <h6>TLDR</h6>

        <p>  I possess super powers when I am drunk. ðŸ’ª   </p>
